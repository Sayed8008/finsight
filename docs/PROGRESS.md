# Progress

Where the project stands, and what comes next. Updated at the end of each
phase.

**Last updated:** 2026-08-15 · **Current state:** Phase 6 complete

## Resuming work

Read these first, in order:

1. `docs/DECISIONS.md` — every architectural decision, with reasoning and
   rejected alternatives. Do not re-derive these.
2. `docs/DATABASE.md` — the schema.
3. This file — what is built and what is next.
4. `git log --oneline` — commit messages explain the *why* of each change.

Then verify the environment still works:

```bash
QT_QPA_PLATFORM=offscreen .venv/bin/python -m pytest    # expect 535 passed
.venv/bin/ruff check .                                  # expect clean
./scripts/dev.sh                                        # backend + client
```

Testing is not a phase. Tests are written within each phase, and every phase

## What exists now

**Backend** — FastAPI on `127.0.0.1:8000`, docs at `/docs`.

| Endpoint | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `GET /health` | liveness; the client uses it to distinguish "down" from "errored" |
| `POST /api/v1/auth/register` | create account, seed 15 categories, return token |
| `POST /api/v1/auth/login` | exchange credentials for a token |
| `POST /api/v1/auth/logout` | authenticated no-op; see ADR-017 |
| `GET /api/v1/auth/me` | the signed-in user |
| `GET /api/v1/categories` | list; filter by type, hides deactivated by default |
| `POST /api/v1/categories` | create |
| `GET /api/v1/categories/{id}` | one category |
| `PATCH /api/v1/categories/{id}` | rename, recolour, deactivate, restore |
| `GET /api/v1/transactions` | paged, filtered, sorted list |
| `POST /api/v1/transactions` | record one |
| `GET /api/v1/transactions/{id}` | one transaction |
| `PATCH /api/v1/transactions/{id}` | edit |
| `DELETE /api/v1/transactions/{id}` | delete, permanently |
| `GET /api/v1/transactions/payment-methods` | distinct methods in use |
| `GET /api/v1/budgets` | list, each with spent/remaining/percentage/status |
| `POST /api/v1/budgets` | set a budget |
| `GET /api/v1/budgets/{id}` | one budget with its utilisation |
| `PATCH /api/v1/budgets/{id}` | change amount, period or category |
| `DELETE /api/v1/budgets/{id}` | delete |
| `GET /api/v1/subscriptions` | list, with costs and renewal timing |
| `GET /api/v1/subscriptions/summary` | monthly/yearly commitment, next renewal |
| `POST /api/v1/subscriptions` | track one |
| `GET /api/v1/subscriptions/{id}` | one subscription |
| `PATCH /api/v1/subscriptions/{id}` | edit |
| `POST /api/v1/subscriptions/{id}/renew` | record a charge, advance the date |
| `DELETE /api/v1/subscriptions/{id}` | delete outright (not the same as cancelling) |

There is no `DELETE /categories/{id}` — see ADR-020. The budget endpoints take
an optional `as_of` date, which decides `is_current` and `days_remaining`; it
exists so those fields can be tested without waiting for the calendar.

**Database** — MySQL 8.4, five tables, one migration applied. Schema in
`docs/DATABASE.md`. Phases 4, 5 and 6 needed no migration: the tables already
existed, and everything they compute is derived, never stored (ADR-015).

**Desktop client** — PySide6. Login and registration screens, then a shell
with sidebar navigation. Three real sections:

- **Transactions** — a `QAbstractTableModel` behind a `QTableView`, a filter
  bar, server-side sorting, a pager, and an add/edit dialog.
- **Budgets** — a summary strip and one card per budget, each with a progress
  bar coloured by status, plus a set/edit dialog.
- **Subscriptions** — a commitment strip, one card per subscription with its
  state and renewal wording, and a track/edit dialog.

Three of six sections are still placeholders.

**Tests** — 535 passing: security, money, budget-arithmetic and billing-cycle
unit tests; model/constraint and repository tests against real MySQL; API tests
for auth, categories, transactions, budgets and subscriptions; and GUI tests
via pytest-qt.

## Next: Phase 7 — Dashboard

The first screen that reads from everything else rather than owning a table of
its own. QtCharts ships with PySide6 and has not been used yet.

1. **Summary endpoint** — income, expenses and net for a period; balance;
   counts. One endpoint, so the dashboard is one request rather than five.
2. **Recent activity** — the latest handful of transactions. The existing
   paged endpoint already serves this with `page_size=5`.
3. **Charts** — spending by category (donut) and a month-by-month trend
   (bars). QtCharts, rendered from data the server aggregated.

**Watch out for:**

- The dashboard must not become five round trips. Aggregate server-side and
  return one payload; the `spend_by_budget` join in `budget_repository.py` is
  the pattern.
- A chart with no data must render an empty state, not an empty axis. Every
  other view has an empty state; charts need one too.
- QtCharts is a separate module (`PySide6.QtCharts`) and a separate import —
  confirm it is present in the pinned PySide6 build before designing around it.
- Colours for category series should come from `category.color`, which is
  already chosen to stay distinguishable. Do not invent a second palette.
- Money stays `Decimal` up to the point a chart needs a float for a
  coordinate. Convert at that boundary and nowhere earlier.

**Deliberately deferred:** period-over-period comparison (8), insight rules (9).

## Known limitations, recorded on purpose

- Logout cannot revoke an issued token (ADR-017).
- The access token is not persisted, so the app asks for a password on every
  launch (ADR-016).
- No rate limiting on login. Worth adding in Phase 11 if time allows.
- Single currency. `currency_code` is stored per user so this can change
  without a backfill.
- The transactions table cannot be sorted by payment method: the API has no
  sort field for it, so that header is deliberately inert rather than
  appearing to work.
- Categories can only be created and edited through the API, not the
  interface — the Settings section is still a placeholder. The endpoints are
  there and tested; the screen is Phase 11.
- Transaction requests are synchronous and block the event loop. Imperceptible
  against localhost; the point to revisit is if the backend ever moves.
- A weekly and a monthly budget cannot both exist for one category, because
  budgets may not overlap (ADR-023). Deliberate: two budgets covering today
  would give "how much is left?" two answers.
- The budgets screen totals only the cards currently on screen. That is a
  presentation sum of figures the server already computed, not a separate
  calculation — but it means the strip reflects the active filters, not the
  whole account. A proper account-wide total belongs to the dashboard (7).
- A budget whose category is later deactivated stays visible and editable. Only
  *attaching* a new budget to a retired category is refused.
- Renewals are recorded by hand ("Mark renewed"). Nothing advances a billing
  date automatically, because nothing runs when the app is closed. A scheduled
  job would be a service, not a desktop app.
- An active subscription whose date has passed shows as overdue rather than
  rolling forward on its own — the app cannot know whether the charge was
  actually taken.
- `POST /subscriptions` accepts a `next_billing_date` in the body and ignores
  it, rather than rejecting the request. Pydantic drops unknown fields; the
  derived value always wins.
